# teststrings

Task

Write a script which reads two strings as arguments and then:

    1. Tests to see if the first string is of zero length, and if the other is of non-zero length, telling the user of both results.
    2. Determines the length of each string, and reports on which one is longer or if they are of equal length.
    3. Compares the strings to see if they are the same, and reports on the result.
